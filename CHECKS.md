# Portfolio Checklist for Javascript Engineers

- [x]  Use clean code: Write clean, well-organized code that is easy to read and maintain. Use comments and meaningful variable names to make your code more understandable to others.
- [x]  Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your code and collaborate with others. This will make it easier to track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
- [x]  Create case studies: Showcase your projects by creating detailed case studies that describe the problem you were solving, your approach, and the results. This will demonstrate your problem-solving skills and give potential employers or clients a better understanding of your work.
- [ ]  Add tracking: Implement Google Analytics or a similar tool to track visits, clicks, and user behavior on your portfolio website. This will help you understand your audience and make informed decisions about your content and design.
- [x]  Add a form: Include a contact form on your portfolio website so potential employers or clients can easily get in touch with you. Make sure to validate user input and handle form submissions securely.
- [ ]  Use at least one API: Integrate at least one external API into your portfolio website to demonstrate your ability to work with third-party services. For example, you could use the GitHub API to display your latest repositories or the Twitter API to show your latest tweets.

- [ ]  Use testing: Write automated tests to ensure your code works as expected and catches bugs early on. Use tools like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Write unit tests and integration tests for your back-end code to ensure it works as expected and catches bugs early on.
- [ ]  Use accessibility best practices: Make sure your portfolio website is accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and other accessibility best practices to ensure your website is inclusive and user-friendly.
